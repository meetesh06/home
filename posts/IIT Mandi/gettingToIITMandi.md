## Packing for the journey
Traveling through mountainous terrain can be a strenuous experience, especially during an overnight journey from Delhi. To help make the journey more comfortable, it's a good idea to pack some light snacks for the trip. I usually recommend packing fruits such as oranges and apples that can provide a quick and healthy energy boost.

For individuals who experience motion sickness or dizziness due to diesel fumes, it's essential to carry anti-nausea medication like Vomisel, which can be easily obtained over the counter at any chemist.

When it comes to traveling to IIT Mandi, there are two good options that I would recommend.

***

## (Recommended) Option 1: Via Delhi

***


### 1. Which bus to book?
If you're traveling to IIT Mandi via bus, my top recommended bus service for this route is the government-run [HRTC](https://www.hrtchp.com/hrtc_info/) buses. These buses offer a reliable and comfortable journey, with the added convenience of being able to book tickets online through the HRTC Official Website. The HRTC buses typically depart in the evening (around 7PM), and the last bus of the day departs at 9:50 PM, so it's essential to plan your journey accordingly. I highly recommend booking an AC Volvo for a more comfortable journey.

Another good option for bus travel is Zingbus. However, in my personal experience, I prefer HRTC over Zingbus. I had a bad experience with a Zingbus driver who forgot to stop at a scheduled stop and refused to come back to pick us up. However, not all Zingbus drivers are the same, and it could have just been my unfortunate experience.


> __A word of caution:__ If you're planning to travel by bus to IIT Mandi, be careful of private bus operators offering deals outside of ISBT. I strongly advise against taking such offers. In my past experience, I once missed my HRTC bus and had to take a private bus as an alternative. It turned out to be the worst bus journey of my life, as the bus was full of loud and aggressive drunk people who were doing drugs. When I asked for a refund, they refused. I had no choice but to continue with the journey, and I vowed never to do it again.

> To avoid such unpleasant experiences, it's always better to stick with government-run bus services like HRTC, which offer reliable and safe journeys at reasonable rates. So, be cautious and make wise choices while traveling to IIT Mandi by bus.

### 2. ISBT Kasmere gate
If you're traveling to ISBT Kasmere Gate in Delhi, the Delhi Metro is a well-connected and convenient option. You can easily reach the Kasmere Gate Metro Station and take **Exit Gate 7** to reach the ISBT Kasmere Gate.

Using the Delhi Metro is a great way to avoid the hassle of traffic congestion and enjoy a smooth and comfortable journey. So, plan your trip accordingly and make the most of the Delhi Metro's extensive network to reach your destination hassle-free.

## Option 2: Via Chandigarh

***

### 1. Which bus to book?
When traveling from Chandigarh to Mandi, I recommend taking a government-run bus such as HRTC or PUNBUS. There are frequent buses on this route, and the journey takes around 5-6 hours. I usually opt for a non-volvo bus that has charging facilities, but you can choose whichever type of bus suits you. While it's possible to buy tickets at the bus stop, I suggest booking them online using the [HRTC Official Website](https://www.hrtchp.com/hrtc_info/) for peace of mind. HRTC is my preferred option as it's reliable and offers good service.

**Note: Carry cash with you if you are planning to buy tickets offline, they don't usually accept UPI.**

### 2. ISBT Sector-43
To catch a bus to Himachal Pradesh from Chandigarh, head to ISBT Sector-43. Keep in mind that Sector-17 is only for local buses towards Punjab, so don't get confused. If you're not sure where to go, don't hesitate to ask for help from the friendly locals. Chandigarh is a beautiful place with warm and welcoming people.

## Getting to campus from Mandi

***
If you're a new student and don't have the option to book a bus from Mandi to the campus, there are two good alternatives:

1. (Recommended if you have luggage) Take a cab: You can easily find a cab outside the bus stop that will take you to the campus. Keep in mind that the price will be high (currently around Rs. 900), so it's better to have a travel partner to split the bill. If you can't find anyone, you can contact a local cab service like Him White Cabs (ask for Naresh or Manish at 09418156918). I've gone on many trips with them and highly recommend them. Feel free to mention my blog if you choose to travel with them.

2. (Recommended if you don't have much luggage) Take a local bus: You can take a local bus from ISBT Mandi that goes to Kamand. If you're going to South Campus, take a ticket for Kamand (which is also known as IIT Kamand Campus). If you're going to North Campus, take a ticket for Salgi (which is the village right outside the North Campus and also the road that goes to Kullu Manali). Keep in mind that this is a busy route and the bus will be fully packed most of the time. However, the journey only takes around 30-40 minutes and costs just Rs. 25 compared to the cab option, which is more than 30 times the cost. I personally prefer this option when I don't have much luggage.
