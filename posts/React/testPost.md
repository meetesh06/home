# No actions, only reactions

I am excited to share with you a new tool I created that generates this blog/website automatically. You can check it out here: [easyNextBlog](https://github.com/meetesh06/easyNextBlog)

This post serves as a starting point for the topics that will be covered in subsequent posts. As I continue to make progress in this area, I will share more information with you.

Some of the topics that will be covered in the future include:

1. Implementing proper state handling in this blog
2. Exploring why the blog works well despite potential redundancy issues
3. The importance of writing clean and efficient code, even if the server will likely cache it anyway
4. And more, as new insights arise

I'm excited to dive deeper into these topics with you and share my learnings along the way. Stay tuned for more!
