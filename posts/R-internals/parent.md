Welcome to the parent post for my upcoming series on R programming. In this series, I'll be diving deep into various topics related to R programming and its ecosystem.

As I explore different aspects of R programming, I'll be sharing my insights and experiences with you in subsequent posts. Here are some topics that I'm planning to cover:

1. R's handling of environments and its implications
2. Challenges in R's static analysis
3. Intermediate language's for R
4. and more, as I continue to learn and explore.

I hope you'll find this series informative and useful in your own work with R programming. Let's dive in and learn together!
